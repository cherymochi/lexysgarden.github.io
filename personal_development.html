                    The last few years have been rather difficult to start, what with the pandemic and being on lockdown. Though I wouldn't have left my house for any social reasons such as parties and like, there was still an immense lack of interaction which I would usually engage in at school. The first year was especially hard as I had complications when applying for university, due to the restrictions of COVID-19. Naturally, my usual feeling of depression was fueled by this and I had remained static for a very long time, losing interest in many of my hobbies and feeling no sense of accomplishment. The development of these strengths really started when I received my acceptance letter, and was filled with encouragement and a sense of purpose. This was when my passion for coding and love for learning were reignited and I would watch and follow along YouTube videos in preparation for what was to  come. My being organized seems to have been more steadfast and covert than the others as I have memories of organizing my books and desk in high school. I may not have noticed it, but now with all my school activities being on a computer, it is very evident in the way I arrange my assignments and notes for each module in each semester and my computer desk where I do most of my work is usually the tidiest section of my room. These strengths now are a far cry from what they were three years ago.

                    One of my tasks for this assignment was to read, summarize and reflect on chapters 4 - 7 of Twelve Pillars by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener.

                    Chapters 4 - 7 of Twelve Pillars by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener set a scenario of two men, Charlie and Michael, meeting at a nearby diner to catch up. During their talk, it is revealed that Michael doesn't have any goals in life and Charlie relays some steps in setting and acheiving goals as given by a mutual, Mr. Davis. Charlie also explains the importance of selecting goals early in life as to not live in regret when you're unable pursue these goals. After some time, Michael's pager ringed signifying that a work matter had surfaced, so they both said their goodbyes and Michael went his way.

                    Three weeks later, they meet again as Michael wanted to share his achievements. After a small chat, Charlie goes into his second bout of advice in relation to friendships and states that Michael may need to make some adjustments in his. He pushes Michael to surround himself with people who will not hold him back and will motivate him to acheive success. Charlie quotes Mr. Davis saying that the people your surround yourself with can influence how you determine your attitude. Charlie's next piece of advice for Michael was to never stop learning and to read more books. He explains that reading is the best way to expand your knowledge, gives Michael a book, and instructs him to visit once he's read it. As Michael left that day, he could feel the budding relationship between him and Charlie.

                    After reading these chapters, it was clear what readers were to take from it. I definitely will listen to the advice of Mr. David and Charlie. I do think I'm already follow some pieces of advice as I try to make friendships with people who can encouragement and push me to working harder, as well as, I try to be that friend to others.
