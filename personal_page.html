                    Hello everyone! My name is Nathalea Evans and the creator of this website. I created this website as an part of my assignment for a university course. I would describe myself as a relatively calm and quiet person, and my friends certainly agree with that. I am pretty introverted so I usually prefer staying inside and watching a TV series than going out, but I try to attend whenever my friends have outings. Below I have listed some of my traits, preferences and hobbies. (✿´ᴗ`)

                    My emotional state can quite sometimes be quite turbulent, but I do my best to keep them under control so I can actually focus on my tasks or I'd never get anything done. Despite how I feel, I always try to appear happy as to not dampen the mood of my environment and inconvenience others. My emotional state really depends on the people around me, as when I'm with family and friends I feel very happy.. and even though I am introverted, I don't like being alone with my thoughts.

                    I had mentioned before that I like staying in and watching a Tv series, however I don't often get to do that as I don't have a lot of free time to really enjoy the series. I think it's more fair to say that I like to watch <a href = "https://www.youtube.com" target = "_blank">Youtube</a> videos in my spare time as they are much shorter than the series I usually indulge in. Other than that, I enjoy playing video games during holiday breaks, listening to songs by my favorite <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1FB8Apu4QRG2AD8HAe8Koh?si=de20b36e90984e15" target = "_blank">group</a> and reading <a href = "https://www.webtoons.com/en/" target = "_blank">web comics</a> online or on my phone. <br>I do have leisurely activities that help further my knowledge in my studies, for example I love following coding tutorials for different languages, namely JavaScript and Python.

        <br><br><br>

        I took a Myers-Briggs test from a rather popular <a href = "https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test" target = "_blank">site</a> to find out my MBTI and after completion, I received type INFJ-T. Reading through each of the traits listed under this type, i.e. the ones shown above, I was really able to relate to each of them in some manner or another. The trait that really stood out to me was Turbulent, as it had such a high percentage. In the description, persons with this trait are said to be incredibly self-concious and sensitive to stress and these can be seen as very negative traits, but reading further it states that those with a turbulent personality are success-driven and perfectionists. Personally, I find myself possessing more of the negative traits, however after consulting some of my friends there was a general consensus of me possessing the positive traits as well. They also agreed that the other traits listed in the image shown above are reminiscent of me. With this in mind, I agree that this test has some validity for my own personality.
        <br>
        As a small experiment, I asked some of my closer peers to take this test as well so I could evaluate their results and infer as to whether or not the Myers-Briggs test has validity in general. After assessing each of their results, I can safely assume the this personality test is indeed valid.
